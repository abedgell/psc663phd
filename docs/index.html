<h1>Course Description</h1>
<p>Since the end of WWII, donor countries have spent over $7 trillion on
foreign aid. Many of these projects seek to enhance human well-being
through improved infrastructure, access to food, education
opportunities, healthcare provision, broadened political freedoms, and
increased security. Yet, the decisions behind when, where, and how to
allocate foreign aid are embedded in domestic and international power
dynamics. Donor countries make strategic choices about which countries
to assist and which target areas to prioritize. Likewise, recipient
governments have their own agendas and engage in strategies to capture
foreign aid. This course examines these dynamics, with a particular
emphasis on how the United States government makes foreign aid
decisions. By the end of the semester, you will have foundational
working knowledge that you can apply throughout your career in public
service, academia, or the private sector.</p>

<h1>Course Requirements</h1>
<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>1. Participation (20%)</h2>
<p>You are expected to attend and participate in all scheduled class
meetings. You should arrive on time and be prepared to discuss the
assigned material. This means that you need to actively engage with the
required readings before class, asking questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What <em>type</em> of material is this (i.e. scholarly research,
policy paper, editorial)?</li>
<li>What is the <em>question</em> or problem motivating this work?</li>
<li>What <em>methods</em> do the author(s) use?</li>
<li>What are the <em>conclusions</em> or main arguments?</li>
<li>How does this work <em>relate</em> to other materials we’ve
discussed in class?</li>
<li>What are the core <em>contributions</em> and <em>limitations</em> of
this work?</li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly encourage you to prepare notes on the readings and bring
them to class.</p>
<p>For each class session, you can earn up to five points toward your
participation grade. To earn points, you must actively participate in
the discussion. You will not earn participation credit for merely
attending class. You may also lose participation credit if you arrive to
class late or if you are not actively listening to the discussion (e.g.,
working on other assignments, doom scrolling) since this is
disrespectful and potentially distracting. It is possible to earn a
negative participation credit score for the day.</p>
</div>
<div id="leading-class-discussion-30" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Leading Class Discussion (30%)</h2>
<p>You will lead the class discussion on 13 September and another week
of your choice. This assignment is intended to give you additional
teaching experience, particularly at the graduate level. You should use
about one hour to present the assigned readings using PowerPoint.
Afterward, you will lead the other students in an activity designed to
help the class better understand the material through active learning.
For 13 September, Dr. Edgell will provide materials and instructions for
the in-class activity. For the other week, you are responsible for
developing the activity, in consultation with Dr. Edgell.</p>
</div>
<div id="paper" class="section level2">
<h2>3. Research Paper (50%)</h2>
<p>You will develop an original research project that investigates an
empirical puzzle related to U.S. foreign aid decisions or
administration. The project should thoroughly address the research
question using qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods. Your final
paper and presentation should have a clearly articulated research
question, review of relevant literature, preliminary theory,
methodology, discussion of results, and conclusion. This is an
opportunity to explore broader questions related to your possible
dissertation research, for a conference paper, or article manuscript. To
help you succeed at this assignment, we will have several meetings and
interim deadlines to track your progress. These are summarized
below.</p>

<div id="excuses" class="section level1">
<h1>Attendance Policy</h1>
<p>Students are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings. A
student may miss class only for good cause and must provide written
documentation in advance or within <strong>48 hours</strong> of the
missed class or as soon as physically possible.</p>
<p>Good cause for missing class, subject to the professor’s discretion,
may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sickness that disables the student from attending class or poses a
significant threat to the health of others</li>
<li>Sickness of, or accident involving, a spouse or dependent, that
requires the student to be with the spouse or dependent</li>
<li>An accident that necessarily prevents the student’s attendance in
class</li>
<li>The death of a family member or friend</li>
<li>An interview for an internship or a permanent position after
graduation, if the interview cannot reasonably be scheduled to avoid a
conflict</li>
<li>A meeting or event at which the student must appear as a
representative of the University (including official athletic
events)</li>
<li>Comprehensive exams, where the department schedules these to take
place on the same day, one day before, or one day after the class
meeting</li>
<li>Jury duty on the same day as the class meeting</li>
<li>Other good cause as is warranted under the circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>Deadlines for other course assignments do not constitute a good cause
for missing class. Extracurriculars (including Greek Life) are also only
generally acceptable excuses for absences if the student is acting as an
official representative of the University (e.g., mock trial tournaments
and official athletic events).</p>
<div id="excessive-absences" class="section level2">
<h2>Excessive Absences</h2>
<p>A student who is absent <em>for any reason</em> from the equivalent
of three class meetings will only be allowed to continue with the course
if they obtain approval from the professor. In such circumstances, the
student will be marked as failing the course with an “F” letter grade
unless they withdraw from the course before the final grading
period.</p>

<h1>Grading Policies</h1>
<p>We will use the following grading scale in this class. Graduate
students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA or higher for all graduate
coursework taken at the University of Alabama. A minimum 3.0 GPA is also
required to be eligible for funding from the department.</p>

<h2>Formatting and Citation Guidelines</h2>
<p>The U.S. Agency for International Development provides a style guide
for all materials it produces. The guide contains useful tips on how to
prepare concisely written and well-formatted documents. It is your
responsibility to familiarize yourself with these guidelines and follow
them when preparing written reports for this class. The guide is

<h2>Missed Exams &amp; Coursework</h2>
<p>As a general rule, I do not accept late work. Deadlines on the <a

successfully achieve the student learning objectives by the end of the
semester. If you cannot meet a deadline or will need to miss an exam for
a good cause, you must provide written documentation within <strong>48
hours</strong> of the missed assignment or as soon as physically
possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="disputes" class="section level2">
<h2>Grade Disputes</h2>
<p>If you think I have made an error, contact me during office hours or
schedule an appointment within one week of receiving the grade. Out of
respect for your right to privacy under the University’s Confidentiality
of Student Records policy and the Family Rights and Privacy Act of 1974,
I do not discuss grades via email.</p>
</div>
<div id="incomplete" class="section level2">
<h2>Incomplete Grades</h2>
<p>Incomplete “I” grades will be recorded only in exceptional cases
when: the student (a) has completed a substantial portion of the course
and is otherwise passing, (b) is unable to complete a well-defined
portion of a course for reasons beyond the student’s control, and (c) in
the instructor’s judgment can complete the required work without
repeating the course.</p>
<p>The University of Alabama policy requires all grades of “I” to be
removed no later than 12 months after the end of the term in which they
were awarded but prior to the student’s graduation or the grade of “I”
will be changed to an “F.” The “I” may not be used as a means to
re-enroll in a course during a subsequent semester. A grade of “I” may
not be used to satisfy a prerequisite requirement.</p>
<p>Requests for “I” grades must be submitted in writing to the
instructor using this form: <a
href="https://forms.gle/JWRZz87gmhyLmBdr9"
class="uri">https://forms.gle/JWRZz87gmhyLmBdr9</a>. Such requests can
be sent no earlier than 01 November 2023 (the last day to drop a course
with a “W”) and no later than 3:30pm on 06 December 2023 (the end of our
last class session).</p>

<div id="plagiarism-and-ai-technology" class="section level1">
<h1>Plagiarism and AI Technology</h1>
<p>Learning to communicate your ideas effectively is an essential skill
for any career path you may eventually take after graduation. While AI
technology is exciting and offers opportunities to improve the
efficiency of our research and writing, misusing this technology has
negative consequences. Bots like ChatGPT are only accurate about 60-70%
of the time and have been known to fabricate information. Using these
tools to write your work for you is not only unethical, it renders you
invisible. Your voice matters! Don’t let an AI silence you.</p>
<p>In line with UA’s Academic Misconduct policy, I expect you to
generate your own work in this course. By submitting an assignment, you
claim this work is entirely your own. Any work that you have paraphrased
should be correctly cited. If you use more than three words in a row
from someone else’s work, use quotation marks and cite the source,
including the page number.</p>
<p>If you submit work generated by someone else or created by a computer
application such as ChatGPT, this will be considered a violation of the
Academic Misconduct policy and may be reported to the Department Chair
or Dean’s office for review.</p>
<p>You may use word processing tools to check your spelling and grammar
and assist with simple re-phrasing tasks. For example, I use the
Grammarly application to help with my writing. It checks spelling and
punctuation and sometimes provides advice on rephrasing sentences for
clarity. This is a perfectly acceptable use of technology. However,
having Grammarly’s AI assistant or similar tools write your work for you
is unacceptable.</p>
